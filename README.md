# Stop and Reroute: An Exercise in End-to-End Routing
This is the simulation directory for our Networks project.

## Directories
This repository consists of three directories:
  - bin: holds the final compiled binaries to run any simulations
  - obj: holds the compiled .o files
  - src: holds the source files for the project

## Building
To build just run
```make```
on any computer with a g++ version that has C++ 11 support.

Currently the Makefile does not support any other targets.
